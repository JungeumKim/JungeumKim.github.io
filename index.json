We focus on generative models  that are likelihood-free and, therefore, render the computation of Bayes factors (marginal likelihood ratios)  far from obvious. We propose a deep learning estimator of the Bayes factor based on simulated data from two competing models using the likelihood ratio trick. This estimator is devoid of summary statistics and obviates some of the difficulties with ABC model choice. We establish sufficient conditions for consistency of our Deep Bayes Factor estimator as well as its consistency as a model selection tool. We investigate the performance of our estimator on various examples using a wide range of quality metrics related to estimation and model decision accuracy. After training, our deep learning approach enables rapid evaluations of the Bayes factor estimator at any fictional data arriving from either hypothesized model, not just the observed data $Y_0$. This allows us to inspect entire Bayes factor distributions under the two models  and to quantify the relative location of the Bayes factor evaluated at $Y_0$ in light of these distributions. Such tail area evaluations are not possible for Bayes factor estimators tailored to $Y_0$. We find  the performance of our Deep Bayes Factors competitive with existing MCMC  techniques that require the knowledge of the likelihood function. We also consider variants for posterior or intrinsic Bayes factors estimation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a relatively high-dimensional real data example about determining cognitive biases.","tags":["Deep Learning","Bayes Factors","Bayesian Inference","Statistical Inference"],"title":"Deep Bayes Factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jungeum Kim","Veronika Rockova"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683417600,"objectID":"d5d20be84aa461b6d2f1df8ef2a1336c","permalink":"https://jungeumkim.github.io/publication/journal-article2/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article2/","section":"publication","summary":"The success of Bayesian inference with MCMC depends critically on Markov chains rapidly reaching the posterior distribution. Despite the plentitude of inferential theory for posteriors in Bayesian nonparametrics, convergence properties of MCMC algorithms that simulate from such ideal inferential targets are not thoroughly understood. This work focuses on the Bayesian CART algorithm which forms a building block of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). We derive upper bounds on mixing times for typical posteriors under various proposal distributions. Exploiting the wavelet representation of trees, we provide sufficient conditions for Bayesian CART to mix well (polynomially) under certain hierarchical connectivity restrictions on the signal. We also derive a negative result showing that Bayesian CART (based on simple grow and prune steps) cannot reach deep isolated signals in faster than exponential mixing time. To remediate myopic tree exploration, we propose Twiggy Bayesian CART which attaches/detaches entire twigs (not just single nodes) in the proposal distribution. We show polynomial mixing of Twiggy Bayesian CART without assuming that the signal is connected on a tree. Going further, we show that informed variants achieve even faster mixing. A thorough simulation study highlights discrepancies between spike-and-slab priors and Bayesian CART under a variety of proposals.","tags":["Bayesian Nonparametrics"],"title":"On Mixing Rates for Bayesian CART","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jungeum Kim","Xiao Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"966884cc0d8ac9e31fab966c4534e973","permalink":"https://jungeumkim.github.io/publication/journal-article/","publishdate":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"The idea of robustness is central and critical to modern statistical analysis. However, despite the recent advances of deep neural networks (DNNs), many studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Making imperceptible changes to an image can cause DNN models to make the wrong classification with high confidence, such as classifying a benign mole as a malignant tumor and a stop sign as a speed limit sign. The trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy is common for DNN models. In this paper, we introduce sensible adversarial learning and demonstrate the synergistic effect between pursuits of standard natural accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we define a sensible adversary which is useful for learning a robust model while keeping high natural accuracy. We theoretically establish that the Bayes classifier is the most robust multi-class classifier with the 0-1 loss under sensible adversarial learning. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm that trains a robust model using implicit loss truncation. We apply sensible adversarial learning for large-scale image classification to a handwritten digital image dataset called MNIST and an object recognition colored image dataset called CIFAR10. We have performed an extensive comparative study to compare our method with other competitive methods. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that our method is not sensitive to its hyperparameter and does not collapse even with a small model capacity while promoting robustness against various attacks and keeping high natural accuracy. The sensible adversarial learning software is available as a Python package at *https://github.com/JungeumKim/SENSE*.","tags":["Robust Deep learning, Adversarial robustness"],"title":"Robust Sensible Adversarial Learning of Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jungeum Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657152000,"objectID":"114eb2cc5a80e7a63a7ad85ac647049c","permalink":"https://jungeumkim.github.io/publication/journal-article3/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article3/","section":"publication","summary":"In this dissertation, we study three important problems in modern deep learning. adversarial robustness, visualization, and partially monotonic function modeling. In the first part, we study the trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy in deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. We introduce sensible adversarial learning and demonstrate the synergistic effect between pursuits of standard natural accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we define a sensible adversary which is useful for learning a robust model while keeping high natural accuracy. We theoretically establish that the Bayes classifier is the most robust multi-class classifier with the 0-1 loss under sensible adversarial learning. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm that trains a robust model using implicit loss truncation. Our  experiments demonstrate that our method is effective in promoting robustness against various attacks and keeping high natural accuracy. In the second part, we study nonlinear dimensional reduction with the manifold assumption, often called manifold learning. Despite the recent advances in manifold learning, current state-of-the-art techniques focus on preserving only local or global structure information of the data. Moreover, they are transductive; the dimensional reduction results cannot be generalized to unseen data. We propose iGLoMAP, a novel inductive manifold learning method for dimensional reduction and high-dimensional data visualization. iGLoMAP preserves both local and global structure information in the same algorithm by preserving geodesic distance between data points. We establish the consistency property of our geodesic distance estimators. iGLoMAP can provide the lower-dimensional embedding for an unseen, novel point without any additional optimization. We  successfully apply iGLoMAP to the simulated and real-data settings with competitive experiments against state-of-the-art methods. In the third part, we study partially monotonic DNNs. We model such a function by using the fundamental theorem for line integrals, where the gradient is parametrized by DNNs. For the validity of the model formulation, we develop a symmetric penalty for gradient modeling. Unlike existing methods, our method allows partially monotonic modeling for general DNN architectures and monotonic constraints on multiple variables. We empirically show the necessity of the symmetric penalty on a simulated dataset.","tags":["Deep learning","Adversarial machine learning","Manifold learning","Monotonic modeling"],"title":"Bridging the gap between human and computer vision in machine learning, adversarial and manifold learning for high-dimensional data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jungeum Kim","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

This framework is composed of two concepts - robust unit that is induced by a combination of any PCA procedure and a restriction function as an outlier filter and two-stage strategy that divides and conquers outliers. As a practical implementation of the proposed framework, we develop a robust PCA procedure, termed robust pair PCA (RP-PCA) by coupling a t-distribution-based probabilistic PCA (T-PCA) with our framework. Moreover, for missing data, we suggest a new procedure for handling missing values that fully exploits EM algorithm of T-PCA under the robust unit. Empirical performance of the proposed method is evaluated through numerical studies including simulation study and real data analysis, which demonstrates promising results of the proposed robust method.","tags":["Robust PCA"],"title":"A Unified Framework of Robust PCA - Use of Robust Unit Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
